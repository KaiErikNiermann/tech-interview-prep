# tech-interview-prep

I collected some of the resoureces I used / am using for interview prep here, hopefully this can help others in their job application journey. 

## directories 

- `materials/` contains some books I found helpful, covering everything from how to prep for behavioral interviews and how to talk through different technical solutions to most aspects of DSA necessary to pass technical interviews 
- `sols/` contains solutions to common programming problems with some annotations behind the general line of thinking
