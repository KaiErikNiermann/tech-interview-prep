## coding-prep

Main websites used by companies / for practice

### software-engineering

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
> [blind 75](https://neetcode.io/practice) seems to be a common "track" of problems people follow for prep, [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) in general has some good prep materials 

[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) 
>  [interview prep kits](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits) should be especially useful if you want to do some short term prep 

[Codesignal](https://app.codesignal.com/)
> Some companies also use this, has a nice simple UI for stuff though is generally less useful than the two

### competitions

[Avent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
> Every year during December AoC hosts a number of challenges each day with varying difficulty, often starting off easy, the [VUCS](https://discord.gg/MGG72qsKrn) usually has a small discussion thread for people doing it, you can also join an official leaderboard if you are a part of [STORM](https://svstorm.nl/)

[Cloudflight Coding Contest](https://register.codingcontest.org/)

### security 

[StudSec](https://ctf.studsec.nl/challenges)
> Especially if you are a student at VU its a nice way to do sec related challenges while also bonding with some people

[Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)

## career prep

### resume template 

> [**Jakes resume**](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) is basically unbeatable in terms of quality, if you populate it with the right keywords it should get you past most resume screens without to many problems

### career fairs

> (**2024**) [**CS and AI**](https://www.ai020.nl/#dm) I believe this is held yearly though I might be wrong, its definitely happening in 2024 though, worth signing up, often enables certain application processes to go more smoothly if you network a little
